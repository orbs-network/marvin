# ORBS CLIENT

Back to [main](../README.md)

This client exercises a virtual chain, in a variety of scenarios.
The 2 most common scenarios are:

* `Stress test`: high-load over short timespan, designed to test the capacity limits of the virtual chain
* `Endurance test`: low-load over a long timespan, designed to test the stability of a virtual chain

## Design

The Orbs Client uses repo `orbs-client-sdk-go` for interacting with the virtual chain.

## Run scenarios

### Stress tests

TBD Configuration

### Endurance tests
